# üîí Security Breach - Cleanup Completed

## üö® What Happened
API keys were accidentally committed and pushed to GitHub in these commits:
- `de53dd5` - "Implemented AiAgent and Test - Passed"
- `fe19f9a` - "updated application usage"

**Exposed Keys:**
- Gemini API Key: `AIzaSyA1q8N6V54g_TgRA_NWd2__HAyrY5t0Hbc`  
- SerpAPI Key: `e3e511d3747d04a6bf2044871a362e60f30536c37e0aa947f3b4974b59f4a85e`

## ‚úÖ Actions Completed

### 1. **Git History Cleaned** 
- Used BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove API keys from entire git history
- Force-pushed cleaned history to GitHub
- Verified keys no longer exist in any commit

### 2. **Secure Configuration Implemented**
- Created `.env` file for local development (not tracked in git)
- Added `.env.example` template for team members
- Implemented `lib/config/env_config.dart` for centralized key management
- Updated all code to use environment variables instead of hardcoded keys

### 3. **Repository Security**
- Added comprehensive `.gitignore` rules for environment files
- Created `run_with_env.sh` script for secure development
- Added `API_KEYS_SETUP.md` documentation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: YOU MUST STILL DO THIS**

### **IMMEDIATELY REVOKE AND REGENERATE API KEYS:**

1. **Gemini API Key** - Go to https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   - Delete key: `AIzaSyA1q8N6V54g_TgRA_NWd2__HAyrY5t0Hbc`
   - Generate a new key
   - Update your `.env` file with the new key

2. **SerpAPI Key** - Go to https://serpapi.com/manage-api-key  
   - Delete key: `e3e511d3747d04a6bf2044871a362e60f30536c37e0aa947f3b4974b59f4a85e`
   - Generate a new key
   - Update your `.env` file with the new key

## üîÑ How to Update with New Keys

1. Edit your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   # Smart Trip Planner API Keys
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_new_gemini_key_here
   SERP_API_KEY=your_new_serp_key_here
   ```

2. Test the app:
   ```bash
   ./run_with_env.sh
   ```

## üìã Security Best Practices Going Forward

- **Never** commit API keys or secrets to git
- Always use environment variables for sensitive data
- Use the provided `run_with_env.sh` script for development
- Regularly audit your codebase for accidentally committed secrets
- Consider using tools like `git-secrets` or `detect-secrets` for prevention

## üõ°Ô∏è Repository Status
- ‚úÖ Git history cleaned
- ‚úÖ Secure configuration implemented
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **API keys need to be regenerated by you**

**This file can be deleted once you've confirmed new API keys are working.**
